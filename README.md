## Overview

A clean, modern, and well-structured React project template using Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and React Router. It is preconfigured with best practices, a recommended folder structure, and aliasing. The goal is to help students set up professional-quality React applications with ease.

## Installation

Create a project folder, example: project-folder. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code and copy and paste this command inside the Visual Studio Code Terminal:

Using NPM?

```
npm create twanasselbergs/react-ts .
```

Using Bun?

```
bun create twanasselbergs/react-ts .
```

Next, head into the react folder, install all dependencies, and run the local development server.

```
cd react && bun i && bun run dev
```

## Folder Structure
